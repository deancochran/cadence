## Benefits of Periodization Training?

So, by using periodization, you're able to make your training more intentional and effective. By breaking your training into distinct phases, you can ensure that you're making steady progress towards your goals while also allowing for adequate recovery time to avoid overtraining and allow your body to adapt to the demands of your training. This can help you avoid injuries, improve your performance, and ultimately reach your end goal.

## Basics of Periodization

Periodization is a method of creating structure for a training plan. By breaking your training into phases, it can allow you be more intentional with your training, and identify what areas of your training need the most attention as well.

1. Base Building: This is the first phase of most training plans, and it’s focused on building a strong foundation of fitness. This is where you’ll put in the time and effort to build a strong base of endurance, muscle, and technique.
2. Build: After you’ve built a strong base, you’ll begin focusing on refining and improving upon the established skills and foundational fitness. More variety to your training plan, targeting specific aspects of your goal, will become valuable here.
3. Peak: Starting to focus on specific races or goals of your plan, the hardest efforts part of your plan should be in this phase. Putting in hard efforts to optimize your training for specific goals, whether that’s a marathon, a triathlon, or a long bike ride will be key to preforming your best on race day.
4. Taper: This phase is designed to help your body recover from the intense training you did in the Peak phase. This is where you’ll start to gradually reduce the intensity of your training and allow your body to rest and recover.

Whether you’re a seasoned athlete or just starting out, periodization can be a game-changer for your training and help you reach your goals.

## Three Levels of Periodization

In order to effectively implement periodization into your training, you have to build structure on multiple levels — or in the world of periodization, cycles. There are three main types of cycles: macrocycles, mesocycles, and microcycles.

Ultimately, your macrocycle comes to an end once you’ve completed your race or hit peak performance (whatever that end goal might look like for your sport). Think of this as the full timeline from when you completed your start training, to the time you complete your new one.

Mesocycles typically last anywhere from a few weeks to a few months, depending on the overall timeline and structure of your periodization. These cycles represent a certain “training block", like "strength" or "speed training".

Microcycles are the smallest unit of the periodization training structure. Most athletes are familiar with Mircocycles when it comes to training plans, since they are often used to describe an athlete’s typical training week. These cycles will include the specific types of workouts planned throughout a 3-10 day schedule. (Mircocycles are essentially you're weekly plan)

## Basic Structure for Periodization

In most training plans, the format starts with a Base training phase, then Build, Peak, Taper, and Recovery.

### Base

This is likely the phase that most endurance athletes are familiar with; it’s where you’ll typically experience a progressive increase in the duration and intensity of your workouts. Now, your base phase can look pretty different from another athlete’s depending on the structure of each microcycle during this stage, but the general purpose will hold true: it’s all about creating a “base” of endurance while throwing some speed training into the mix.

#### Preparation Mesocycle

During this mesocycle, your training will be focused on shorter durations and low-moderate intensity with the primary goal of getting your body back to its basic fitness levels and usual mileage.

The length of your preparation phase can vary depending on the timeline of your macrocycle and the style of periodization. Some athletes may not require as much time to readapt to their usual training habits, and others may need a little while longer to get their body warmed up again.

## Build Phase

Your build phase will include more intense training at a moderate volume, likely involving a wider variety of training. For example, you’ll probably have more long, low-intensity workouts as well as some extra short, high-intensity interval exercises.

It might sound like a lot to strive for within one phase, but remember: you aren’t taking on all of this at once, but over the span of several weeks. This is where the more detailed structure of a microcycle will help you keep tabs of all your workouts and ensure that you’re getting all the necessary variation for your progression.

## Peak Phase

The peak phase occurs just a few weeks prior to your race, usually consisting of somewhere around 2-3 weeks of training

## Taper Phase

Most often, people are suggested to taper within 3-14 days of before their race, depending on the intensities and volume of training completed in the build phase.

### Recovery Phase

Think from the grand scale of your macrocycle: if you just ended one training macrocycle by finishing a race, your body’s in need of some hearty recovery time before you start up another macrocycle. Even elite level athletes will take 2-4 weeks to recover following a race season.

If you haven't just completed a race, or a training plan this mesocycle is optional.

## Periodization for Fitness

Programming a periodized training plan for fitness clients is, in many ways, more challenging than for athletes. Athletes have a clearly defined preseason, in season, and off season, which can simplify the process of setting goals and creating timelines.

General population personal training clients do not have such a rigid structure. However, that does not mean a long-term training plan is unnecessary. In fact, it is even more necessary and can serve as a goal setting exercise to increase client motivation and retention. There are a few guidelines to consider.

### Limiting consecutive mesocycles with identical goals to three or fewer

Varying the training stimulus is a good thing.5 Training the same movements, at the same intensity, with the same goal for longer than a few mesocycles will likely lead to monotony and training staleness.

## Variables to consider when forming a periodized traing plan

- Time until plan is completed

When ‘distribution’ is assessed as ‘time spent’ or ‘distance covered’, rather than number of sessions. The training often described as polarized in the literature is in fact a pyramidal distribution. Division of these distinctions is critical because misclassification creates more zone 3 or zone 1 and less zone 2.

### Key things to check

Step 1. Assess your current training distribution. Calculate this from time spent in the different zones, rather than number of sessions.

Step 2. Check the difference between prescribed distribution and actual athlete executed distribution. This is a common place of disconnect in training execution.

Next, rather than chase a specific percentage, a better question is to focus on the training response to your current prescription. Here are some questions to guide you:
