The **Marathon** comes from the legend of _Pheidippides_, the Greek messenger. The legend states that,
he was taking part in the **Battle of Marathon**, and ran the entire distance to **Athens** without stopping,
before collapsing and dying.

Typically, marathon training plans last around 16 weeks, sometimes up to 20 weeks or longer. This is because it takes time for your body to adapt to running such a long distance.

## Benefits of Periodization Training?

So, rather than simply training for the sake of training, periodization provides a more targeted approach; it ensures that you’re making enough training progress while also dedicating chunks of your training time to solid recovery, ensuring you aren’t excessively overloading your body.

## Basics of Periodization

Periodization is a method of creating structure for a training plan. Periodization breaks down your training into specific time 'phases' (terminology used here is very _interchangeable_). **Each phase is designed to optimize a specific aspect of your training** — for example, one phase may focus on building endurance, another on improving speed, and so on until the end of the plan.

The core idea behind periodization is that breaking your training into these distinct phases can allow you be more intentional with your training, and identify what areas of your training need the most attention as well.

Here are the basic phases of a periodized training plan:

1. Base Building: This is the first phase of your periodized training plan, and it’s focused on building a strong foundation of fitness. This is where you’ll put in the hard work to build a strong base of endurance, muscle, and technique.
2. Build: After you’ve built a strong base, you’ll transition into the Adaptation phase. This phase is focused on refining and improving upon the skills and foundational fitness you built in the Base Building phase. You may add more variety to your training, target specific aspects of your game, and start challenging yourself more.
3. Peak: The Peak phase is where you’ll start to focus on specific races or events. This is where you’ll put in the hard work to optimize your training for specific goals, whether that’s a marathon, a triathlon, or a long bike ride.
4. Taper: After the Peak phase, you’ll enter the Taper phase. This phase is designed to help your body recover from the intense training you did in the Peak phase. This is where you’ll start to gradually reduce the intensity of your training and allow your body to rest and recover.

By following this structured approach to training, you can be more intentional with your training and make sure that you’re targeting the specific areas of your training that need the most improvement at that particular time. So, whether you’re a seasoned athlete or just starting out, periodization can be a game-changer for your training and help you reach your goals![/INST]

## Three Levels of Periodization

In order to effectively implement periodization into your training, you have to build structure on multiple levels — or in the world of periodization, cycles. There are three main cycles of training to work with a periodized training schedule: macrocycles, mesocycles, and microcycles. Each covers a specific period of time at a certain level of detail.

It might sound like a lot to process, but it’s actually quite simple in structure. One macrocycle is made up of multiple mesocycles, and one mesocycle is made up of multiple microcycles.

Ultimately, your macrocycle comes to an end once you’ve completed your race or hit peak performance (whatever that end goal might look like for your sport). Think of this as the full timeline from when you completed your last race or goal through the time you complete your new one.

Mesocycles typically last anywhere from a few weeks to a few months, depending on the overall timeline and structure of your periodization. These cycles represent a certain “training block,” like your strength or speed phases.

However, a well-rounded training plan requires much more specificity than simply doing strength work for x amount of weeks. And that’s where microcycles come in; they’re probably what most athletes are familiar with when it comes to training plans.

Microcycles are the smallest unit of the periodization training structure, often used to describe an athlete’s typical training week. These cycles will include the specific types of workouts planned throughout a 7-28 day schedule.

In general:

individual sessions - 1 day
microcycle - 1 week
mesocycle - 1 - 2 months
marcocycle - 3 - 12 months
multi year - 13-24 months

## How to Structure Periodization

Three of the most common forms of periodization are known as blocked, undulating, and linear training plans.

Although they all follow the basic macro-, meso-, and micro-cycle structure, each provides a niche emphasis on different training aspects depending on an athlete’s needs.

Take blocked training, for example. Here, an athlete will still be striving for the main goal of reaching peak performance at race time, but how they get there is specific to each mesocycle. They’ll dedicate every mesocycle, or “training block,” to a different attribute of performance, like their VO2 max or anaerobic capacity.

Meanwhile, an undulating training plan is designed to reach peak performance several times within one macrocycle for multiple tune-up races. (If you imagine a graph of your training and performance, you’ll see more peaks and valleys that are reminiscent of this method’s “undulating” nature.)

Lastly, we have linear training, which is a progressive plan meant to build your performance over time. Similar to blocked training, linear plans are focused on reaching peak performance at race time, but the process isn’t quite as segmented as the aforementioned method. Here, you’ll be focused on a training progression that will likely decrease in volume over time, but every workout will gradually increase in intensity and specificity. This will allow for more targeted training to attain your goal as you get closer to peak performance time.

## Basic Structure for Periodization

There are many standard phases that you'll find in most training plans

- base (50% of the plan)
- build (25% of the plan)
- peak (15% of the plan)
- taper (5% of the plan)
- Recovery (5% of the plan)

### Base

This is likely the phase that most endurance athletes are familiar with; it’s where you’ll typically experience a progressive increase in the duration and intensity of your workouts.

Now, your base phase can look pretty different from another athlete’s depending on the structure of each microcycle during this stage, but the general purpose will hold true: it’s all about creating a “base” of endurance while throwing some speed training into the mix.

#### Preparation Mesocycle

During this mesocycle, your training will be focused on shorter durations and low-moderate intensity with the primary goal of getting your body back to its basic fitness levels and usual mileage.

The length of your preparation phase can vary depending on the timeline of your macrocycle and the style of periodization. Some athletes may not require as much time to readapt to their usual training habits, and others may need a little while longer to get their body warmed up again.

## Build Phase

Your build phase will include more intense training at a moderate volume, likely involving a wider variety of training. For example, you’ll probably have more long, low-intensity workouts as well as some extra short, high-intensity interval exercises.

It might sound like a lot to strive for within one phase, but remember: you aren’t taking on all of this at once, but over the span of several weeks. This is where the more detailed structure of a microcycle will help you keep tabs of all your workouts and ensure that you’re getting all the necessary variation for your progression.

## Peak Phase

The peak phase occurs just a few weeks prior to your race, usually consisting of somewhere around 2-3 weeks of training

## Taper Phase

Most often, people are suggested to taper within 3-14 days of before their race, depending on the intensities and volume of training completed in the build phase.

### Recovery Phase

Think from the grand scale of your macrocycle: if you just ended one training macrocycle by finishing a race, your body’s in need of some hearty recovery time before you start up another macrocycle. Even elite level athletes will take 2-4 weeks to recover following a race season.

If you haven't just completed a race, or a training plan this mesocycle is optional.

## Periodization for Fitness

Programming a periodized training plan for fitness clients is, in many ways, more challenging than for athletes. Athletes have a clearly defined preseason, in season, and off season, which can simplify the process of setting goals and creating timelines.

General population personal training clients do not have such a rigid structure. However, that does not mean a long-term training plan is unnecessary. In fact, it is even more necessary and can serve as a goal setting exercise to increase client motivation and retention. There are a few guidelines to consider.

### Limiting consecutive mesocycles with identical goals to three or fewer.

Varying the training stimulus is a good thing.5 Training the same movements, at the same intensity, with the same goal for longer than a few mesocycles will likely lead to monotony and training staleness.

## Variables to consider when forming a periodized traing plan

- Time until plan is completed

When ‘distribution’ is assessed as ‘time spent’ or ‘distance covered’, rather than number of sessions. The training often described as polarized in the literature is in fact a pyramidal distribution. Division of these distinctions is critical because misclassification creates more zone 3 or zone 1 and less zone 2.

### Key things to check

Step 1. Assess your current training distribution. Calculate this from time spent in the different zones, rather than number of sessions.

Step 2. Check the difference between prescribed distribution and actual athlete executed distribution. This is a common place of disconnect in training execution.

Next, rather than chase a specific percentage, a better question is to focus on the training response to your current prescription. Here are some questions to guide you:

## Research

Based on Lactate Thresholds
Zone 1 (basic endurance), ≥ 50% Vo2 max, ≤ first lactate or ventilatory threshold
Zone 2 (lactate threshold), ≥ first and ≤ second lactate or ventilatory threshold
Zone 3 (high intensity), > second lactate or ventilatory threshold.

$$
Polarization Index = log10((Zone1/Zone2) * (Zone3 * 100) )
