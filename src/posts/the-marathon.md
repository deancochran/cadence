## Choosing a Marathon

> "No human is limited" -Eliud Kipchoge

Typically, marathon training plans last around 16 weeks, sometimes up to 20 weeks or longer. This is because it takes time for your body to adapt to running such a long distance.

When selecting a marathon, it's important to find one that you care about finishing. Consider not just the race itself, but also the organization hosting the event. The host organization is responsible for the entire event, from course marshals to finish line officials. The team dedicated to the race operations is the one you'll be dealing with the most.

They are the ones who will have the most information about the race day, including any potential issues or concerns. If a host organization is dedicated to making their race a success, you can be confident that they will do everything in their power to ensure a safe and enjoyable experience for all participants.

### Have a Goal

Having a clear reason for starting a marathon training is crucial. Having a goal, whether it be a personal record, a specific time or just to finish, is what drives you to push through the distance. It's psychologically important to have a goal, as it gives you a sense of purpose and direction. Without a goal, it's easy to get discouraged, lose motivation, miss workouts, or simply give up.

### Knowing your Limits

It's important to know your limits and not set yourself up for disappointment or failure. A marathon is a significant undertaking. It's important to realistically assess your current fitness level and ability to commit to the training required. If you're setting yourself up for a goal that is unrealistic, it will psychologically deter you from wanting to complete your training or even the event.

### Notes on Race Selection

An early spring or fall race no longer guarantees a cool race day, as many runners prefer. Of course, weather is an uncontrollable factor, but you can look at the weather from the last three to four years of a specific race to get a sense of the typical forecast.

## Fundamental Training Concepts

### Building your weekly volume

Building your total weekly mileage over time by running more frequently each week per week will help you establish a consistent base for the other sessions in your plan.

Developing this _base_ is essential for experience runners. Without this you have no platform to build speed or improve your pacing as you get closer to the race.

### Long Runs

Preforming a long run every 7-10 days to allow your body to adjust to longer distances. This session is a critical component of your training plan because it helps your body adapt to the demands of a marathon. These long runs are not supposed to be an "all out" sprint. Rather a moderate to steady pace, is sufficient for most training plans.

### Speed Work

Practicing intervals, tempo runs, and high intensity session to increase your speed will help you perform at a higher level on race day and recover more effectively after the race. Speed Work is one of the most effective ways to increase your marathon times.

### Rest and Recovery

Arguably the most important concept. Rest is essential for preventing injuries and mental burnout. Giving your body enough time to recover between runs and long runs will help you perform at your best on race day and come back stronger after the race.

> Adaptation comes from ensuring you have proper rest, allowing your body to fully recover.
