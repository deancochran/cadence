# Full Stack SvelteKit Starter Pack

Welcome to the Full Stack SvelteKit Starter Pack! This repository provides a solid foundation for building web applications with SvelteKit, incorporating various technologies and tools such as SvelteKit, Lucia for authentication, Prisma for the database, Skeleton UI for basic styling, SvelteKit Super Forms for form handling, and Zod for validation. This README will guide you through the setup and usage of this starter pack.

## Features

- **SvelteKit**: A powerful framework for building web applications with a focus on simplicity and performance.

- **Lucia Authentication**: Lucia is a lightweight authentication library for SvelteKit that provides user authentication and authorization functionalities out of the box.

- **Prisma Database**: Prisma is a modern database toolkit that simplifies database access, making it easier to work with databases like PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite.

- **Skeleton UI**: A minimal and responsive CSS framework to give your project a clean and simple starting point for styling.

- **SvelteKit Super Forms**: An advanced form handling library for SvelteKit that streamlines form development and validation.

- **Zod Validation**: Zod is used for schema-based validation to ensure data integrity and enhance security.
