## Getting Started with SkAuth

Before you begin, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

- Node.js: You can download and install it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

## Create a SvelteKit Project

Follow these steps to create a new SvelteKit project:

1. Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to create your project.

2. Run the following command to clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone my-sveltekit-app
   ```

   Replace `my-sveltekit-app` with the name of your project.

3. Navigate to your project directory:

   ```bash
   cd my-sveltekit-app
   ```

## Install Dependencies

Before you can start your SvelteKit app, you need to install the project dependencies. Run the following command:

```bash
npm install
```

## Running the Development Server

To start the development server and see your SvelteKit app in action, run the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server and provide you with a URL (usually `http://localhost:3000`) where you can access your app in a web browser.

## Building for Production

To build your SvelteKit app for production, use the following command:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will generate optimized files in the `build` directory that you can deploy to a web server.

## Running Tests

SvelteKit comes with built-in testing capabilities. To run the tests, use the following command:

```bash
npm test
```

## Folder Structure

SvelteKit follows a conventional project structure. You can find the key directories in your project:

- `src`: This is where you'll write your Svelte components and application logic.
- `static`: Static files like images, fonts, or JSON data can be placed here.
- `routes`: Define your application routes in this directory.

## Customize Your App

Now that you have your SvelteKit app up and running, you can start customizing it by editing Svelte components, creating new routes, and adding your application logic.

Refer to the [SvelteKit documentation](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs) for more details on how to use SvelteKit to build web applications.
