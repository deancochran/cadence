Be sure you are on the latest game build to see the new refreshed workout library!

The comprehensive list of individual workouts has slimmed down, as some are structured very similarly to others. Is one of your favorite workouts missing? No worries, you can download the ZIP file here
zwift_workouts_all_collections_ordered_Nov20.zip (2.6 MB)
that contains the legacy workouts. Not sure how to import a ZWO file? Check out this article here 1.2k or this 482 how-to video.

These are the legacy workout collections that were removed in Zwift game version 1.49. As an example - the Pebble Pounder workout collection is gone, but Zwifers will still be able to access the Pebble Pounder training plan via the plans section.

After you download the ZIP file - unzip it to your PC 179 or Mac 88.
Within each workout collection folder are individual workouts as ZWO files.

Once added to your Zwifting PC or Mac - workouts will sync with iOS / Android / Apple TV devices.
